# TON On-chain NFT FEED

NFT Feed is the MVP of a social network built around NFT on TON. Explore Web 3 content, promote your NFTs using TON advertising smart contracts.

## Problematics

There are many creative collections in TON, but they are not visible on the marketplaces - in the top are collections that have a large marketing budget, as well as created a long time ago. Viewing Web content is not convenient on marketplaces and makes it difficult to find new NFTs.
